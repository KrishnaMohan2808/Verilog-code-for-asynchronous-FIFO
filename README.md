# Verilog-code-for-asynchronous-FIFO
This repository contains a Verilog implementation of an asynchronous FIFO module with independent read and write clocks. It handles full and empty conditions, overflow, and underflow. The testbench verifies FIFO operations, including writing, reading, and testing edge cases like full and empty states.
